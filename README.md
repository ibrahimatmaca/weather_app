# Weather App

In this project, a Weather application for cubit has been developed by using [HardwareAndro](https://www.youtube.com/c/HardwareAndro) channel.

## Getting Started

The API_KEY and BASE_URL used in the project are hidden as .env files.

You can get your own API KEY and your relevant URL to connect to the API as a member from the link I have specified. [Weather API](https://www.weatherapi.com/)

After you become a member, open a file named .env inside the flutter file.

I show you BASE_URL , WEATHER and API KEY to keep my own API information confidential.
```
BASE_URL = BASE_URL
WEATHER = WEATHER
API_KEY = API_KEY
```
If you have uploaded the relevant parts from the site I mentioned to your .env file, you are now ready to run your project.
